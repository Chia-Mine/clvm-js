### Changed
- Made `op_div` bug-compatible with `clvm_rs`
- Replaced npm package `@chiamine/bls-signatures` with `bls-signatures`

## [1.0.9]
This version is compatible with [`389efa3fbe65c77600da63c78d29c0866d292754`](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm/tree/389efa3fbe65c77600da63c78d29c0866d292754) of [clvm](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm)

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue of `as_javascript` with tuples inside tuples and ending with 0

## [1.0.8]
This version is compatible with [`2722c78ddb92f067c5025196f397e4d2955f9053`](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm/tree/2722c78ddb92f067c5025196f397e4d2955f9053) of [clvm](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm)

### Fixed
- Fixed typo in error message
- Fixed an issue where `op_substr` did not work as expected.
- Fixed an issue where cost calculation for `op_subtract` was not correct.
- Fixed `limbs_for_int` return wrong value when argument is `0`.
- Fixed an issue where `Bytes` comparison returns wrong result in some cases.
- Fixed an issue where `op_softfork` crashed with argument atom larger than or equal to 53bit.
- Fixed G1Element error message.

## [1.0.7]
This version is compatible with [`2722c78ddb92f067c5025196f397e4d2955f9053`](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm/tree/2722c78ddb92f067c5025196f397e4d2955f9053) of [clvm](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm)

### Added
- Added type declaration file `browser/index.d.ts` on build.
### Changed
- Changed SExp/CLVMObject properties `atom` and `pair` to readonly to prevent potential bug.
- Changed `src/__bls_signatures__.ts` location to `src/__bls_signatures__/index.ts` to prepare for future wasm-loading tweaks.
- Upgraded `@chiamine/bls-signatures` to 0.2.1-beta.2.
- Use `CLVMType` instead of `CLVMObject` as a valid type representation of `CLVMObject`.  
  (CLVMObject should not be used as a type because there might be number of type incompatibility due to new private field)
- <strike>Replace `**` operator on `BigInt` by user-defined function because babel or some transpiler always converts `**` to `Math.pow` which cannot be used with `BigInt`</strike>  
  - Although I tried this, it turns out to be 100x slower than `**` operator, so I gave up. It is required to disable such a transform by end-developer. See detail [here](./README.md#browser-compatibility)

## [1.0.6]
This version is compatible with [`2722c78ddb92f067c5025196f397e4d2955f9053`](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm/tree/2722c78ddb92f067c5025196f397e4d2955f9053) of [clvm](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm)

## [1.0.0]
This version is compatible with [`1a5cb17895d8707f784a85180bc97d3c6ebe71a0`](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm/tree/1a5cb17895d8707f784a85180bc97d3c6ebe71a0) of [clvm](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm)

### Removed
- Removed `.dist` folder from git.  
  - This folder made it harder to check diffs between versions.
### Added
- Added GitHub Action
- Added `str()`, `repr()` utility functions.
- Added `Bytes::subarray` to get bytes data without additional memory allocation/copy.
### Changed
- Updated README.md
- Changed method name `Bytes::get_byte_at` to `Bytes::at` (Breaking change).
### Deprecated
- Deprecated python specific type definition such as `str`, `int`. Use `string`, `number` instead.

## [0.0.19]

**There are 2 breaking changes.**  
- Changed `OperatorDict` arguments format.  
Past: `OperatorDict(atom_op_function_map, quote_atom, apply_atom, unknown_op_handler)`  
New: `OperatorDict(atom_op_function_map, option)`  
where `option` is `{quote_atom: Bytes, apply_atom: Bytes, unknown_op_handler: typeof default_unknown_op}`

- When you initialize `Bytes` using constructor like `new Byte(data)`, `data` is not copied but just stored and keeps reference of `data`, for performance enhancement.  
In javascript, byte copy by `TypedArray` constructor is not sufficiently fast.  
So I left user an option how to initialize `Bytes` instance. Data copy, or Store reference.  
If you want to copy data and cut reference apart, then please get `Bytes` instance by `Bytes.from` factory function.  

**Resolved a deep tree performance issue**  
Before this version, `yarn test serialize_test --testNamePattern=test_very_deep_tree` was really slow. It took around 80 seconds to complete test.  
At this version, I've managed to improve test complete time to `79s` -> `2s` by pre-allocating buffer memory on `Stream` instance.

### Changed
- Changed `OperatorDict` arguments format.
- When you initialize `Bytes` using constructor like `new Byte(data)`, `data` is not copied but just stored and keeps reference of `data`, for performance enhancement.
- Greatly improved overall performance by pre-allocating buffer memory on `Stream` instance.
- Improved performance of `Bytes::equal_to`.
- Changed parameter type of `SExp::equal_to` from `CastableType` to `any`
- Replaced use of `instanceof` operator for non-native types.
- Updated bls-signatures version to 0.2.1-beta.1
- Improved `Bytes::concat` performance.
- Reorganized dist folder
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where `SExp.to(<boolean>)` did not work the same as python's clvm.
- Fixed an issue where Bytes-SExp comparison like `b('aaa').equal_to(SExp.null())` did not work.
- Fixed an issue where `OperatorDict` did not throw Error when either `quote` or `apply` is not specified.
### Added
- Added `list()` function working similar to Python's `list()`.
- Added `Bytes::repeat` function.

## [0.0.18]
### Changed
- Fixed an issue where `int_to_bytes` did not work as expected if the argument is a negative number.
- Changed `Bytes::toString()` to return python's `bytes.__repr__` style string.

- Fixed a minor issue

## [0.0.12]
### Fixed
- Don't remove leading '00' or 'ff' when serializing SExp to hex string.
- Fixed an issue where `SExp.to(0)` is converted to `SExp(0x00)` where `SExp(0x80)` is expected.
- Fixed an issue where it raises an Error when executing `Bytes::equal_to(None)`.
- Fixed a minor issue

## [0.0.11]
### Changed
- Made `EvalError::_sexp` public.

## [0.0.10]
### Added
- Added `h(<str>)` helper function which equals to `Bytes.from(<str>, "hex")`
### Fixed
- Removed type-guard from `SExp::listp()`
- Removed `SExpAsAtom` type and `SExpAsPair` type as they seem not working.


## [0.0.9]

- Added `Bytes::decode()`
- Added `Bytes::startswith()` and `Bytes::endswith()`
- Added `SExpAsAtom` type and `SExpAsPair` type.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where `SExp.to(<str>)` falls in infinite loop.

## [0.0.4]
### Changed
- Changed source of `bls-signatures` to `@chiamine/bls-signatures`
  - When installing from previous `Chia-Mine/bls-signatures#npm`, the npm module version is too old or unstable.  
    Sometimes it installed the latest commit and another time installed old cache.  
    I decided to install the module not from GitHub branch but official npm registry for stability.
- Updated README

### Fixed
- Fixed various eslint errors

## [0.0.3]
### Added
- Added `to_sexp_f` export to index.ts/index.js
